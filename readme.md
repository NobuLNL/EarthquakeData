# Washington Fire Data

This repository showcases Washington fires and their locations. The dataset includes Washington's geographical shape data in GeoJSON format. I opted for the dark Mapbox theme to enhance readability. To represent the fire data, I utilized a fill option due to its polygonal format instead of individual points. All the data utilized originates from the **State of Washington Open Data Portal**.
